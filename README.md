# ITVB23KM02
This repository contains my solutions to the exercises for the **ITVB23KM02 (Machine Learning)** course at Hanze University of Applied Sciences.

The course materials can be found at [the official course repository](https://github.com/hanze-hbo-ict/Machine-Learning).

## Exercises Overview
The exercises are divided into four parts, each focusing on a different aspect of machine learning. The exercises are written in Python and are based on the following libraries:
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `scipy`
- `tensorflow`

The exercises are available in the following formats:
- **Notebooks**: These are interactive Jupyter notebooks that contain the exercises and additional information.
- **Scripts**: These are Python scripts that contain the exercises and can be run from the command line.
